		<h1>Computers For Girls Initiative</h1>
		<p> The goal of Computers For Girls (C4G) is to co-develop, field test and disseminate engaging tools to assist organizations and schools that are working to improve STEM education for 1 million girls in developing countries.  In the first year these tools will be suggested and co-developed by the C4G management Team, C4G staff and seven teachers from schools in Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  In the second year, these tools will be further field tested and disseminated more widely by the seven teachers to all teachers at four nearby schools.  In the third year the tools will be further disseminated via the iEARN global project platform and via WCE capacity building, preloaded content and local training to the 1,000 WCE Partner organizations in 78 developing countries to impact a million girls. </p>
